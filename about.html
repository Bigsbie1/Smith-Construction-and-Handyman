    <h1>About Me – Joshua Wayne Smith</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Joshua Wayne Smith, and I bring over 30 years of experience in the construction and handyman industry.
      Throughout my career, I have built a reputation for delivering high-quality workmanship, attention to detail, and
      dependable service across a wide range of residential and commercial projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      I take great pride in developing strong customer relationships, built on trust, clear communication, and consistent results.
      Many of my clients return time and again or refer others, often complimenting the quality of my work and the professionalism I
      bring to every job.
    </p>
    <p>
      From home repairs to full renovations, I approach each project with dedication, integrity, and a commitment to excellence.
      My goal is always the same: to exceed expectations and ensure complete satisfaction — every time.
